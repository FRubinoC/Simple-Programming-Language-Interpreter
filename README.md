# Simple-Programming-Language-Interpreter
This project consists on the implementation of the interpreter of a simple programming language. The interpreter provided misses the lexer and parser modules, acting directly on an AST. The work has been done for the first homework of the Language Based Technology for Security Course at the Master Degree in Cybersecurity at the University of Pisa.
